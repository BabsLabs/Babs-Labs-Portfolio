This is code for my website for BabsLabs - my coding company. 

It was build using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.

Version control was managed by using Git, GitBash, and GitHub.

The editor I used was VSCode with a live server plugin.

The site also was built by using Node, SASS, and a NPM (Node Package Manager) to install Node SASS to compile the SASS to be readable by the browser. This meant using the terminal and creating .json files. something I had never done before.

I also used the Font Awesome icon library and Google Fonts libraries.

This is the most advance site I have created to this point.
